            <p>
                I like to creep around my home and act like a <strong>goblin</strong>. I don't know why but I just
                <b>enjoy</b> doing this. Maybe
                it's my way of dealing with stress or something but I just do it <i>about once every week</i>. Generally
                I'll carry
                around a sack and creep around in a sort of crouch-walking position making goblin noises, then I'll walk
                around my house and pick up various different “trinkets” and put them in my bag while saying stuff like
                “I'll be having that” and laughing maniacally in my goblin voice (“trinkets” can include anything from
                stuff
                I find on the ground to cutlery or other utensils). <br>
                The other day I was talking with my neighbours and they mentioned hearing weird noises like what I wrote
                about and I was just <em>internally screaming</em> the entire
                conversation. I'm 99% sure they don't know it's me but god that 1% chance is seriously weighing on my
                mind.
